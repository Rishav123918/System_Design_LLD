/*
üåü Decorator Class ‚Äî Definition
A decorator class is a design pattern component that wraps an existing class (or object) to add new behavior or responsibilities dynamically without modifying the original class itself.

üß© Key Points
‚úÖ Implements the same interface or abstract class as the component it decorates.
‚úÖ Holds a reference to the object it decorates (composition).
‚úÖ Delegates core behavior to the wrapped object and adds its own behavior before or after delegating.

üìù One-liner Definition
A decorator class extends the functionality of an object dynamically at runtime by wrapping it with additional behavior.

üîç Example in Context
In the Coffee example:

SimpleCoffee implements Coffee.

SugarDecorator also implements Coffee and wraps another Coffee object.

SugarDecorator delegates core methods to the wrapped object while adding sugar-specific logic.
